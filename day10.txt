Delegates:
----------
delegates are similar to function pointers in c++
delegate are type safe and they are reference type
delegate is an object which refer one more methods
delegates are invoke methods at runtime
why delegates?
1.delegates we can use in call back functions(calling the fun by passing other fun as parameter)

SetInterval(()=>{})
function f()
{
}
SetInterval(f)
public int Add(int a,int b){}
Add(2,3)
2.delegates are using in multi-threading
Thread t=new Thread(Add);
t.start();
3.delegates are using in event-handling
4.delegates are use in Linq expressions
db.Employees.SingleOrDefault(e=>e.Eid=1000)
delegates refer methods which are having same singnature of delegates
